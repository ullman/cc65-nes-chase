#Chase

This is a game for Nintendo Entertainment System. It is designed by Shiru, see
below. I just made it build using a Makefile and updated a few minor things to
make it compile with the current head of the cc65 compiler.

##Compiling

1.Install the free 6502 compiler: https://cc65.github.io/
Make sure you build the runtime libraries for the nes.

2.Edit the Makefile to point to the compiled nes.lib

3.Run "make" in the /src directory

4."Chase.nes" file is built in the /src dir.

##Original documentation

This is an example game that is developed for my article Programming NES games in C. The article itself is located at my website in the Articles section, to make things simpler in case of possible updates.
